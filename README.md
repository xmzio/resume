# Xavier Muñiz's resume repository

This is the source repository of my professional resume on the web.

You can visit the rendered site here:  
[xmzio.github.io/resume](https://xmzio.github.io/resume)

The content is written in plain text files and formatted using [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), a lightweight markup language.

It is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static website generator, and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

The resume template is custom made, but it was originally based on the `Page` layout of the [Minima theme](https://jekyll-themes.com/jekyll/minima).

It uses basic features of the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) frontend toolkit.

The stylesheet has a `@media print` section and the content has intentional page-breaks, so the same page can generate the PDF version of the resume.

I have abstracted the theme into its own repository; feel free to fork it and use it for your own resume (it is released under the permissive [MIT License](LICENSE)):
